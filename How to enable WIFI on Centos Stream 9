# The Why

You might installed your Centos just now and figured out that it couldn’t access to the Internet. You might try to ping google and it outputs the annoying `ping error: network is unreachable`. You have to complete some configurations to solve the problem.

# The How

1.Verify the Wireless Device

First, check if your wireless device is recongized by the system:

```bash
$ nmcli device status
```

If you see an output with your wireless device(e.g. wla5s0), it is recogized.

If it indicates the wifi device is `unmanaged`, make it `managed`:

```bash
$ nmcli dev set wla5s0 managed yes     # Replace wla5s0 with your Wi-FI device name
```

Check whether the wifi device is blocked:

```bash
$ rfkill list
```

If the WI-FI is blocked, unblock it:

```bash
$ rfkill unblock wifi
```

2.Check NetworkManager Status

Ensure NetworkManager is running:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl status NetworkManager
```

If it’s not running, start abd enable it:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
$ sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
```

3.Check dependency packages

It’s necessary to provide the Wi-Fi device driver for the system:

You can download the driver from the device providers’ official website, say intel: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005511/wireless.html

Download the right driver file according to your Wi-Fi device, move it into `/lib/firmware/` and uncompress it:

```bash
$ mv iwlwifi-*.tgz /lib/firmware/
$ tar -xvf iwlwifi*.tgz
```

It’s necessary to install the `NetworkManager-wifi` packge for the system to enable WIFI feature. Check whether the package has been installed on your system:

```bash
$ rpm -qa | grep -i networkmanager
```

If the package not exists, you can download it from this link: http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php

Search for `NetworkManager-wifi` and pick one suitable for your system architecture, say x86_64:

Install the package:

```bash
$ dnf install NetworkManager-wifi-*.rpm --disablerepo='*'
```

You might find that there are other packages lacking as well(such as iw, wpa_sup and wireless-regdb), no worries, install them in the same way.

4.Restart NetworkManager

```bash
$ systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

Or you can reboot:

```bash
$ reboot now
```

Now your Wi-Fi feature should have been enabled.

5.Connect to the Wi-Fi

Let’s connect to your Wi-Fi

First, let’s obtain the list accessible Wi-Fi’s:

```bash
$ nmcli dev wifi rescan
$ nmcli dev wifi list
```

Then, Let’s get to connect it:

```bash
$ nmcli dev wifi con "your_SSID" password "your_password"   # Basically, SSID is your Wi-Fi's name.
```

Finally, let’s determine whether it can access the Internet now:

```bash
$ ping 8.8.8.8
```

It works! Congratulations!
