# The Why

# The What

We can use Trojan to proxy the traffic download commands, such as yum and wget. Trojan is a secure socks5 proxy and you can configure it to handle all your traffic by using a tool like proxychains.

# The How

## 1. Obtain the subscription link

Make sure you have the correct subscription link provided by your service provider, such as Flower Cloud.

## 2. Install Trojan-GFW and configure it

First , install Trojan-GFW on your system. You can download it from **[Link]**

Download Subscription Configurations

Trojan-GFW does not natively support subscription links directly within its configuration file, but you can use third-party tools to parse the subscription link and generate the configuration files.

You can use tools like [clash](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash) (cross-platform) to parse the subscription link.

Configure Trojan-GFW Manually

Once you have the node configurations, you can manually configure config.json for Trojan-GFW.

```json
{
  "run_type": "client",
  "local_addr": "127.0.0.1",
  "local_port": 1080,
  "remote_addr": "your-remote-server-address",
  "remote_port": 443,
  "password": [
    "your-password"
  ],
  "ssl": {
    "verify": true,
    "verify_hostname": true,
    "cert": "",
    "cipher": "TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",
    "sni": "your-sni",
    "alpn": [
      "http/1.1"
    ]
  }
}
```

Run trojan-gfw

```bash
./trojan -c /path/to/your/config.json
```

## Send requests through the proxy

You can use curl with the --socks5 option to specify the proxy. By default, Trojan listens on 127.0.0.1:1080 for SOCKS5 proxy connections.

```bash
curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:1080 https://www.youtube.com   # socks5-hostname option ensures that DNS resolution is handled by the proxy, which can often resolve issues related to SSL/TLS and connectivity.
```

You can also proxy the traffic of yum, wget and other commands. Prepend proxychains4 to your yum command to route it through the proxy.

Install proxychain4

```bash
$ sudo yum install proxychains-ng
```

**Configure proxychains**:

Edit the proxychains configuration file /etc/proxychains.conf to use your SOCKS5 proxy.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/proxychains.conf
```

Go to last line, replace this line

```bash
socks4  127.0.0.1 9050
```

to this

```bash
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080
```

**Use proxychains with yum**:

```bash
sudo proxychains4 yum install <package_name>

sudo proxychains4 wget <URL>
```

# Summary

While Trojan-GFW does not support subscription links directly, you can use tools like v2rayN or Clash to parse the subscription link and generate configuration files. Then, you can manually configure Trojan-GFW with the appropriate server details.
